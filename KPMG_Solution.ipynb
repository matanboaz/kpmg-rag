The industry saw a shift towards digitalization, automation, and more resilient production networks in the 20th century, exemplifying broader patterns of technological change, globalization, and social transformation. Geographical reorganization of production led to the displacement of textile industries from North America and Western Europe to countries like Japan, the \"Asian Tigers\" (Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore), and eventually to lower-wage economies like China, Indonesia, and Thailand.\n",

Significant developments include the Northrop automatic loom, improvements in finishing processes, electrification of factories, and the emergence of new challenges such as labor conditions and technological innovation. Industrialization outside the Western core, particularly in Japan, accelerated in the early 20th century, leading to shifts in global production networks. The Great Depression and World War II had significant impacts on the industry, with the development of synthetic fibers pointing towards a post-war future. By the mid-1980s, production shifted to lower-wage economies like China, Indonesia, and Thailand, leading to a new international division of labor.

In the food industry, the transformation began in the nineteenth century with urbanization, scientific discoveries, and mechanical innovations leading to the adoption of industrial manufacturing techniques and food preservation technologies. Similarly, the automobile industry transitioned from craft production to mass production with the introduction of Fordist principles and assembly line techniques in the early twentieth century. This evolution allowed for increased production volumes, reduced costs, and greater efficiency in manufacturing processes. In the textile industry, mechanization and technological advancements in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries led to the shift from cottage industry to fast fashion, with increased production capacity and the ability to meet the demands of a growing global market.

            "\n",
            "Lean manufacturing outperformed Fordism because it emphasized waste elimination, continuous improvement (kaizen), just-in-time inventory management, built-in quality, and flexible production methods. This approach, developed by Toyota and other Japanese producers, allowed for fewer worker hours per vehicle, higher quality levels, quicker development of new models, and efficient production of a variety of models in smaller volumes. In contrast, Fordism, while revolutionary in its time, was more focused on mass production techniques and did not prioritize the same level of efficiency, quality, and flexibility that lean manufacturing did. As consumer preferences shifted towards smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, lean manufacturing's emphasis on efficiency and adaptability allowed Japanese manufacturers to gain a competitive advantage over Western manufacturers still using Fordist production techniques. This ultimately led to the widespread adoption of lean production principles in the late 1980s as companies recognized the need to improve their production systems to remain competitive in the changing automotive industry.\n",
